Dear User,

We hope this message finds you well. We appreciate your engagement with Wisperly and regret to hear that you are considering deleting your account. Before proceeding with this irreversible action, we want to ensure that you are aware of the implications and provide you with the necessary information.

**Account Deletion Information:**

- **Consequences:** Deleting your account will permanently remove all associated data, including your profile information, preferences, and any content you've shared. This action cannot be undone.

- **Lost Data:** Once your account is deleted, we will not be able to recover any data or information linked to your account.

- **Recovery:** If you ever decide to return to Wisperly in the future, you will need to create a new account, and none of your previous data will be accessible.

**How to Proceed:**

If you are sure about deleting your account, please follow these steps:

1. Open the Wisperly application on your device.

2. Navigate to the account settings or profile section.

3. Look for the option to delete or deactivate your account.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to confirm and complete the account deletion process.
